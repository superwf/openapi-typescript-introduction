    These 'slide' step styles were heavily inspired by HTML5 Slides:
    http://html5slides.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styles.css

    ;)

    They cover everything what you see on first three steps of the demo.

    All impress.js steps are wrapped inside a div element of 0 size! This means that relative
    values for width and height (example: `width: 100%`) will not work. You need to use pixel
    values. The pixel values used here correspond to the data-width and data-height given to the
    #impress root element. When the presentation is viewed on a larger or smaller screen, impress.js
    will automatically scale the steps to fit the screen.

    Now, when we have all the steps styled let's give users a hint how to navigate
    around the presentation.

    The best way to do this would be to use JavaScript, show a delayed hint for a
    first time users, then hide it and store a status in cookie or localStorage...

    But I wanted to have some CSS fun and avoid additional scripting...

    Let me explain it first, so maybe the transition magic will be more readable
    when you read the code.

    First of all I wanted the hint to appear only when user is idle for a while.
    You can't detect the 'idle' state in CSS, but I delayed a appearing of the
    hint by 5s using transition-delay.

    You also can't detect in CSS if the user is a first-time visitor, so I had to
    make an assumption that I'll only show the hint on the first step. And when
    the step is changed hide the hint, because I can assume that user already
    knows how to navigate.

    To summarize it - hint is shown when the user is on the first step for longer
    than 5 seconds.

    The other problem I had was caused by the fact that I wanted the hint to fade
    in and out. It can be easily achieved by transitioning the opacity property.
    But that also meant that the hint was always on the screen, even if totally
    transparent. It covered part of the screen and you couldn't correctly clicked
    through it.
    Unfortunately you cannot transition between display `block` and `none` in pure
    CSS, so I needed a way to not only fade out the hint but also move it out of
    the screen.

    I solved this problem by positioning the hint below the bottom of the screen
    with CSS transform and moving it up to show it. But I also didn't want this move
    to be visible. I wanted the hint only to fade in and out visually, so I delayed
    the fade in transition, so it starts when the hint is already in its correct
    position on the screen.

    I know, it sounds complicated ... maybe it would be easier with the code?
*/

.hint {
  /*
        We hide the hint until presentation is started and from browsers not supporting
        impress.js, as they will have a linear scrollable view ...
    */
  display: none;

  /*
        ... and give it some fixed position and nice styles.
    */
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 200px;

  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  color: #eee;
  text-align: center;

  font-size: 50px;
  padding: 20px;

  z-index: 100;

  /*
        By default we don't want the hint to be visible, so we make it transparent ...
    */
  opacity: 0;

  /*
        ... and position it below the bottom of the screen (relative to it's fixed position)
    */
  transform: translateY(400px);

  /*
        Now let's imagine that the hint is visible and we want to fade it out and move out
        of the screen.

        So we define the transition on the opacity property with 1s duration and another
        transition on transform property delayed by 1s so it will happen after the fade out
        on opacity finished.

        This way user will not see the hint moving down.
    */

        above.

        First after 4.5s delay we animate the transform property to move the hint
        into its correct position and after that we fade it in with opacity
        transition.
